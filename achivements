What have I learned
13.06

1) alias for template:
using Ptr = std::shared_ptr<T>;
    Ptr<int> p;

2) template method implementation signature:
template<class T>
shared_ptr<T>::shared_ptr() 

3) How to see content of shared lib:
nm -D --defined-only

How to see shared lib dependencies:
ldd

4) If you compile class template as shared library, you need to have precompiled instantiations OR definition in header

5) make install
Do not use system include path for your libraries in internal-use-only sources (e.g. unit tests). You'll need to do make install every fucking time.
